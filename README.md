Evil vimish-fold
================

Integration of [vimish-fold][vimish-fold] with [evil][evil]

Adds normal vim keybindings of `zf` and `zd` to create and delete folds (via
`vimish-fold`) respectively. Also adds normal vim keybindings for fold toggling,
opening, closing etc.

This provides a near-complete vim folding experience in evil.
